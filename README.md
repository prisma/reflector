# @prisma-spectrum/reflector

Utilities for meta-level interactions with the Prisma toolkit in Node.js.

⚠️ **Warning**: This is not a formal Prisma product like `prisma`, `@prisma/client`, etc. If you get value from it great, but there are no guarantees about the vision of this package. That said this package will honour semantic versioning. It is used within Prisma in some projects but also outside such as `nexus-prisma`.
